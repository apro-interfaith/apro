Since its beginnings in 2003, APRO has produced an extensive series of reports and submissions on the principles of religious freedom and harmony in Australia.

## Submission on the Exposure Draft of the Freedom of Speech (Repeal of S.18C) Bill 2014

<time>April 2014</time>

>Section 18C is important as a declaration by government that Australians are entitled to be protected against the expression of racial abuse. It follows that the proposed reductionin the scope of that protection would represent a signal to racists that government has become less interested in providing that protection.
>
>Accordingly we would respectfully submit that the draft Bill should not proceed, and that the Racial Discrimination Act should remain unchanged.

## APRO Position Paper: Addressing Religious Discrimination in Australia

<time>October 2012</time>

>This position paper will consider the nature of racism and discrimination experienced in Australia on the basis of religion, and will also look to what we, as a responsible community, can do to eradicate these incidents and promote and support a harmonious multi-faith and multicultural Australia.
>
>The paper seeks to highlight issues for consideration by government, religious and community leaders, and the community at large, to ensure that Australia both protects the inherent right to freedom of religion and sends a clear message that discrimination and racism on the basis of religious belief is unacceptable and, indeed, in many instances, unlawful.

## APRO submission to the Australian Human Rights Commission on Freedom of Religion and Belief in the 21st Century

<time>February, 2009</time>

>In the decade since the report released by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) on Freedom of religion and belief, the international climate has altered dramatically and Australian public policy has changed in response. In this environment security considerations and strategies need to be positively balanced by proactive measures to ensure a harmonious society that embraces cultural and spiritual diversity. It is also critical that CALD and religious communities are not driven into segregationist and isolationist responses to the backlash against muticulturalism and the suspicion of cultural and religious difference.
>
>This submission addresses six key areas for consideration within debates surrounding freedom of religion and belief in Australia:
>
>1. Legislation
>2. Education
>3. Employment
>4. New Technologies
>5. The Media
>6. Gender Equality
