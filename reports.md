Since its beginnings in 2003, APRO has produced an extensive series of reports and submissions on the principles of religious freedom and harmony in Australia.

## Faith Matters: an interfaith agenda for a religiously plural Australia

**A submission by the members of the Australian Partnership of Religious Organisations (APRO) to members of the Australian Parliament and Government.**

<time>31 March 2011</time>

Given the recent resurgence of religious voices in public discourse and in the light of Australiaâ€™s long term commitment to and support of Freedom of Religion and Belief APRO makes six recommendations it considers important to the next phase of harmonious and productive interreligious relations in Australia.

## APRO submission to the Australian Human Rights Commission on Freedom of Religion and Belief in the 21st Century

<time>February, 2009</time>

In the decade since the report released by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) on Freedom of religion and belief, the international climate has altered dramatically and Australian public policy has changed in response. In this environment security considerations and strategies need to be positively balanced by proactive measures to ensure a harmonious society that embraces cultural and spiritual diversity. It is also critical that CALD and religious communities are not driven into segregationist and isolationist responses to the backlash against muticulturalism and the suspicion of cultural and religious difference.

This submission addresses six key areas for consideration within debates surrounding freedom of religion and belief in Australia:

1. Legislation
2. Education
3. Employment
4. New Technologies
5. The Media
6. Gender Equality
